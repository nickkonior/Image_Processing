Scripts to implement filters on images 

2_1 : Mean filter on flowers.jpg under different AWGN levels (SNR = 10, 15, 18 dB) using kernel sizes 5×5, 7×7, 9×9; compare smoothing effect and MSE deviation.

2_2 : Median filter on flowers.jpg with salt-and-pepper noise (p = 10–25%) using kernels 5×5 and 7×7; evaluate noise removal and MSE error.

2_6 : Histogram equalization on im1.jpg and im2.jpg (custom vs OpenCV equalizeHist); compare histograms and DCT2 spectra to analyze contrast and structure changes.

2_7 : Homomorphic filtering on car.jpg with first-order Butterworth high-pass filter; enhances contrast and lighting by balancing low/high frequencies.
